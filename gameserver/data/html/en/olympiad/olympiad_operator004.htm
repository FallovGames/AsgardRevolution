Grand olympiadmpiad Manager :

Grand olympiadmpiad points are needed to become a Hero. The person who earns the most points in each class will be the Hero of the Era. In addition, if you earn more than a certain number of Grand olympiadmpiad points, you will be rewarded with the Noblesse Gate Pass regardless of whether or not you become a Hero.
